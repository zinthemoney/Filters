# Sample Filters Project

## Notes

1. This should be a text representation of the price range the user is searching on, e.g. $500 - $2000.
2. This should be a double ended slider allowing the user to alter both max and min values. It has a min value of 500 and a max value of 10,000
3. This should be a text representation of the bedroom range the user is searching on and should support both contiguous and non-contiguous ranges. For example, all of the following are valid:
  *Studio, 2 Bed, 4 Bed+
  *Studio - 2 Bed, 4 Bed+
  *Studio - 1 Bed
4. This should be a set of buttons allowing the user to select the bedrooms to search on. When clicked the button should change color to indicate selection
